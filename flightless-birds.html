            <p>Flightless birds are a diverse group of birds that have evolved to live without the ability to fly. While penguins are the most well-known flightless birds, there are many others, each with unique adaptations to their environments.</p>

            <h2>Examples of Flightless Birds</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ostrich:</strong> The largest bird in the world, native to Africa. Unlike penguins, ostriches are adapted for running and can reach speeds of up to 45 mph.</li>
                <li><strong>Emu:</strong> Native to Australia, emus are the second-largest bird species. They are similar to ostriches in their running ability but differ greatly from penguins in habitat and diet.</li>
                <li><strong>Kiwi:</strong> A small, nocturnal bird native to New Zealand. Unlike penguins, kiwis are terrestrial and have a highly developed sense of smell.</li>
                <li><strong>Rhea:</strong> A South American bird that resembles a smaller ostrich. Rheas are adapted for running and live in grasslands, unlike penguins, which are aquatic.</li>
                <li><strong>Cassowary:</strong> A large, colorful bird native to the tropical forests of New Guinea and northern Australia. Cassowaries are known for their powerful legs and are very different from penguins in behavior and habitat.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Comparisons to Penguins</h2>
            <p>While penguins are adapted for swimming and live primarily in cold or temperate aquatic environments, other flightless birds have evolved for different purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> Penguins are aquatic, while most other flightless birds are terrestrial and live in grasslands, forests, or deserts.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Penguins are excellent swimmers, using their flippers to propel through water. Other flightless birds, like ostriches and emus, are adapted for running with strong legs.</li>
                <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Penguins primarily eat fish, krill, and squid, while other flightless birds have diets ranging from plants to insects.</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Penguins are generally smaller than ostriches and emus but larger than kiwis.</li>
